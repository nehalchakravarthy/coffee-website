        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          The word "coffee" entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch
          koffie, borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish kahve, borrowed in turn from
          the Arabic قهوة qahwah. The Arabic word qahwah was traditionally held
          to refer to a type of wine whose etymology is given by Arab
          lexicographers as deriving from the verb قَهِيَ qahiya, "to lack
          hunger", in reference to the drink's reputation as an appetite
          suppressant. The term "coffee pot" dates from 1705. The expression
          "coffee break" was first attested in 1952.

        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
          Several species of shrub of the genus Coffea produce the berries from
          which coffee is extracted. The two main species commercially
          cultivated are Coffea canephora (predominantly a form known as
          'robusta') and C. arabica. C. arabica, the most highly regarded
          species, is native to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia and the
          Boma Plateau in southeastern Sudan and Mount Marsabit in northern
          Kenya. C. canephora is native to western and central Subsaharan
          Africa, from Guinea to Uganda and southern Sudan.

        <h2>Cultivation</h2>
        <p>
          The traditional method of planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each
          hole at the beginning of the rainy season. This method loses about 50%
          of the seeds' potential, as about half fail to sprout. A more
          effective process of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise
          seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve
          months. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn,
          beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers
          become familiar with its requirements.
